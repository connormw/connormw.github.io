I'm currently a junior at Virginia Tech double majoring in electrical engineering and mathematics. My EE degree concentration is in RF and microwave electronics. Why RF? Because it's the closest thing we have to magic, nothing can convince me otherwise. Despite RF design being notoriously challenging, I find myself drawn to it because of the challenge. I think that hard problems are interesting problems. Within the RF domain, I'm especially interested in RFIC design, particularly in the context of chips for telecommunications and wireless applications. It's astonishing to me that the wildly complex and intricate wireless communications systems that define modern life are driven by tiny chips in places like our smartphones and WiFi routers. In addition to RF, I'm very interested in signal processing and math. The two of course go hand in hand, with my life long love for math fueling my interest in the other. 

In my free time, I enjoy playing piano and listening to music. Most of my playing experience is with classical piano, but in recent years I've tried branching out. I can find things I enjoy in any genre of music, but nowadays I mostly listen to alt-rock or jazz and jazz-influenced music. Beyond music, I've also always had an interest in history, especially military history. My favorite historical topics are the Napoleonic Wars and World War 2.
