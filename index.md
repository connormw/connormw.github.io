title: "About Me"
---

I'm currently a senior at Virginia Tech double majoring in electrical engineering and mathematics. My EE degree concentration is in RF and microwave electronics. As one might guess, I want pursue a career in RF. I'm especially interested in RF/analog IC design for communications, particularly wireless, applications. It's astonishing to me that the wildly complex and intricate communications systems that define modern life are driven by tiny chips no more than the size of a quarter. In addition to RF and analog design, I'm also interested in signal processing, digital communications, and math. 

In my free time, I enjoy playing piano and listening to music. Most of my playing experience is with classical piano, but in recent years I've been branching out. Lately I've also been trying to pick up guitar too. I can find things I enjoy in any genre of music, but nowadays I mostly listen to alt-rock and jazz or jazz-influenced music. Beyond music, I've also always had an interest in history, especially military history. My favorite historical topics are the Napoleonic Wars and World War 2.
