This is a collection of some of my (non-academic) projects. Click on any project's link to be taken to a detailed documentation of it. 

* **[Microwave Components - Design, Construction, and Validation:][microwave]** My attempts to design several common distributed element microwave components such as filters, couplers, and dividers. I simulated my designs using [QUCS][qucs], an open source multi-purpose simulation software. The physical designs were implemented using copper tape on half-exposed FR-4 board with varying results.
